A player's "Hand," which depicts the card in the hand, is available to you. These cards are hidden from the opponent. The cards you have already played and are prepared to assault are those that are "InPlay." This cards are visible to the opponent. Finally, you have "Opponent's InPlay," which shows the cards your opponent has already played and is preparing to use against you.
This game will take you Old days of playing Trading Cards in Hand but give you more digital field 

There are many other things we can do to enhance it: currents this game works in a single PC but we can enhance its capability to run players in many different machine.
